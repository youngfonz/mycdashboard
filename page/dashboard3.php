        Do more fireside chats: We noticed a spike in the amount of happy chats during your fireside chat conversation. That really was a hit. We suggest you continue to do more of those.
      </li>
      <li class="recommend-list">
        We also suggest that you use the MyChannel platform as the main screen at the events so people in the room can see th slides and chat. This way they can join in the chat conversation, we feel it makes it a more immersive multi location experience. This will also make the slides match during the presentation because they will be controlled from one source.
      </li>
      <li class="recommend-list">
        Please remember to follow up with your audience. We suggest you ask them what did they like about the experience and what would like to see improved. Please also tell them to continue the converations before and after events on the platform. There is always great 24\7 content to experience.
